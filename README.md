# 🧠 Retail Analytics Project: Profitability Optimization & Customer Insights

## 📌 Overview

End-to-end data science project on \~180,000 retail transactions to diagnose a sudden Q4 2017 profit drop and build solutions around margin optimization, customer segmentation, and CLTV forecasting.

---

## 🔍 Key Components

### 1. 📉 Profitability Root Cause Analysis

* Uncovered 48% drop in sales (Q3 to Q4 2017) despite record order volume (6,041 orders).
* Identified steep average discounts (\~33%) on low-value items as main contributor.
* Validated quarterly profit variance using ANOVA (F=81.56, p<0.001).

### 2. 🤖 Profit Prediction (XGBoost)

* Engineered features like shipping delays, discount interactions, and time trends.
* Achieved:

  ```
  R² = 0.9997 | RMSE = 0.70 | MAE = 0.44
  ```
* Enabled proactive pricing and margin strategy per order.

### 3. 🧍‍♂️ Customer Segmentation (KMeans)

* Segmented customers into 4 groups using RFM and geolocation data.
* Visualized clusters via PCA for marketing personalization.

### 4. 💸 CLTV Forecasting (BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma)

* Predicted 6-month revenue per customer and classified into High/Mid/Low tiers.
* Informed budget allocation and loyalty strategy.

### 5. ⏳ Churn Risk Modeling (Survival Analysis)

* Kaplan-Meier and CoxPH models used to estimate time-to-churn and key risk drivers.
